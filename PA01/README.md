This is my PA01. 
***Required Features***
-Rotate cube by modifying update function. Uses GLM rotate to calculate transformation.
-Shader loader removes shader programs from main.cpp. Loader now loads shader files.
***********************

***Other Features***
-Rotates clockwise instead of counter-clockwise. This is accomplish with a negative unit vecture.
********************

***Notes***
-Shader loader is very basic. It does not load shader program from command prompt. Will modify in later revisions.
-This is the resubmission as suggested by Dr. Harris. 
***********

***Bugs***
-Tor mentions a bug with shader loader. The bug appears if there is garbage read between the end of the shader's text and before the \0 is inserted. This did not cause point deduction but maybe probmatic latter. 
-Status: Attempt fix not sure it works because I was not able to replicate the bug.
