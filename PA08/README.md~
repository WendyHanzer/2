PA04: Model Loading
========================================

What this project does
----------------------

> Loads a model created in blender and displays it on the screen. It *should* 
> handle triangles as well as quads (triangulating the shape if it is a
> quadrilateral.  It also should handle models that have vetices only,
> vertices and textures, verticies and normals, or all 3.

What this project does not
--------------------------
> This project does not handle complex models, models other than .obj files
> or models with complex (more than 4 sides) or concave shapes.
> 
> It's just a simple loader! 

The Good, Bad, and Ugly
-----------------------

> The key source of frustrations for this project came from getting the model
> to properly render to the screen, but this problem was resolved by setting
> the number of vertices to render in the render call back to be equal to the 
> number of vertices in the model.  
> 
> Once this was resolved, the rest was relatively easy.  The program should
> detect if it is dealing with a quad, and if so triangulate.  If not, it
> handles the regular triangle face.
> 
> The one issue that does persist is I receive failure to compile when I try
> to compile a cube.  The dragon and my hockey table load fine, but the cube
> fails everytime.  I thought this was due to not having a null terminator on 
> my shader string, but even after adding it still fails.
> 
> Overall a much greater success than the original submission




Building This Example
---------------------

*This example requires GLM*

The excutable will be put in bin
