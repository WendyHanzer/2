This is my PA03. 
***Required Features***
Keyboard Special Keys
-Left key causes a clockwise rotation.
-right key causes a counter clockwise rotation.
-Could have just change rotation direction instead by multiplying dir by -1 but decided this wanted two keys to do different things.
***********************

***Other Features***
Speed
-Both moon and planet use the same speed variable for rotation however moon will always orbit correctly regardless of planet rotation.
-If the planet is not allowed to rotate, the moon rotation speed can still be changed using number keys 1-6.
********************

***Notes***
-Moon orbit direction is not affected by planet however, rotation direction is though.
-Can be change but requirement only state orbit needs to be unaffected.   
***********

***Bugs***
-Tried the extra credit. Used glbitmapcharacter, glbitmapstring, and the stroke functions with no success. 
-I tried rastering coordinates and then using those function but it would not show text on my machine. However, on other people's machine it would show up but rotate around moon.
